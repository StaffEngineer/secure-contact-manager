# Secure Contact Manager

To run the application please follow `README.md` instructions in `server` and `client` folders.  

Essentially, the application has server-client architecture. Server is written using `express`, saving encrypted data into a file.
Client is written using `Svelte`, making REST API calls to the server.

Tested on node v16.17.0/macOS/Chrome.
